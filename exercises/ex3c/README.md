#Containers and Cloud Foundry Hands-On Labs

##Exercise 3c: Containerize the Application

Ensure that you are in sub-directory `ex3c`.

```
cd <path-to-folder>/CFContainersHOL/ex3c
```

Also make sure you're logged into IBM Containers and you have the environment variable `CONTAINER_NAMESPACE` instantiated. We will use this variable primarily as a unique value to avoid namespace clashes.

***Note: If you are running on Windows, you may need to carefully look at subseqent commands and substitute the environment variable `CONTAINER_NAMESPACE` in each command manually***

You can rerun the following command if required.

```
export CONTAINER_NAMESPACE=$(cf ic namespace get)
```

Now run the following command

```
echo $CONTAINER_NAMESPACE
```

If the output is blank, you need to go back to exercise 1.

Notice the `Dockerfile` in this directory. Its contents looks something like below.

```
FROM tomcat:7-jre7
MAINTAINER Rags

RUN ["rm", "-fr", "/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT"]
COPY /./target/pcfdemo.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war

CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
```

We start with a base tomcat image, deploy the application, instantiate the container and start it. Pretty straightforward!

Let's build the container with the following command. This might take a ***long time*** depending on the network connection.

```
cf ic build -t $CONTAINER_NAMESPACE/pcfdemo .
```

Which should yield an output like below.

```

Running the command

```
cf ic images
```

Should yield the following output (partially reproduced). Notice that the image was just created. Notice that the image was created just moments ago.

```
REPOSITORY                                               TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
registry.ng.bluemix.net/ragsns/pcfdemo                   latest              21ddb28f803d        4 minutes ago       359.3 MB
```

Let's create an instance of the container as below. We strictly don't need to create a container group, but we do so anyway because it provides us with a route than to have do it explicitly.

```
cf ic group create  -p 8080 --name pcfdemo --hostname pcfdemo-$CONTAINER_NAMESPACE --domain mybluemix.net --memory 512 --max 1 --desired 1 registry.ng.bluemix.net/$CONTAINER_NAMESPACE/pcfdemo
```

This should yield an output as below.


```
Create group in progress
Created group pcfdemo (id: 85538824-3ba9-461a-bc92-6a7a54a2430a)
Minimum container instances: 0
Maximum container instances: 1
Desired container instances: 1
```

Issue the following command

```
cf ic group inspect pcfdemo
```

This will output the status of the container group as below. Eventually, the status of the group will change to `CREATE_COMPLETE` as shown below.

```
{
    "Cmd": [], 
    "Creation_time": "2016-02-03T22:43:52Z", 
    "Env": [

        "pcfdemo-ragsns.mybluemix.net"
    ], 
    "Status": "CREATE_COMPLETE", 
    "Updated_time": null
}
```

Now browse the URL as shown above which should be `pcfdemo-$CONTAINER_NAMESPACE.mybluemix.net` with the `CONTAINER_NAMESPACE` substituted and you should see the application deployed in a container.

Notice the message `No RabbitMQ service bound - streaming is not active`. We will do that later.

We will clean up by issuing the following command.

```
cf ic group rm -f pcfdemo
```
Let's delete the route explicitly as well.

```
cf delete-route mybluemix.net -f -n pcfdemo-$CONTAINER_NAMESPACE
```

# Summary

We saw how we can containerize an application and deploy into Bluemix containers with relative ease.

We will connect to a service, next.

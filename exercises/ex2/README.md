#Containers and Cloud Foundry Hands-On Labs

##Exercise 2: Push your application

Make sure you ran the following command already.

```
git clone https://github.com/ragsns/CFContainersHOL
```
If you do not have the `git` command line tool, you can just click on the button `Download ZIP` from the URL `https://github.com/ragsns/CFContainersHOL` to download locally.

Next, ensure that you are in sub-directory `ex2`.

```
cd <path-to-folder>/CFContainersHOL/exercises/ex2
```

We will use the Pivotal Cloud Foundry field engineering [demo](https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/PCF-demo).

Push the application with the following command.

```
cf push
```

You should see at output something like below.

```

```

Your application has now been deployed. You can verify that by running the following command.

```
cf apps
```

Which should produce an output that looks something like below.

```
cf apps
Getting apps in org raghsrin@us.ibm.com / space dev as raghsrin@us.ibm.com...
OK

```

If you browse the URL from the output above you should be able to see a heat map that is not yet active since we've not connected a service. You will also notice a message "*No RabbitMQ service bound - streaming is not active*" indicating that the RabbitMQ service is not hooked up the application, yet.

You can get the application logs with the following command. We will subsequently connect to a log provider such as papertrail or splunk.

```
cf logs pcfdemo --recent
```

You can delete the application with the following command, which will not prompt you and also delete all associated routes.

```
cf delete -f pcfdemo
```

and verify that it is deleted as below.

```
cf apps
```

```
No apps found
```

# Summary

We pushed a Cloud Foundry app with a `cf push` command. The Cloud Foundry platform used the appropriate buildpack and the application was made available.

We will look at the manifest file and how to connect to a service, subsequently.
